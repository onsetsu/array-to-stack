# array-to-stack
A useless(?) utility to test webpack module workflow.

## Installation

As npm for Node.js:

```
$ npm install array-to-stack --save
```

Or download the [bundle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onsetsu/array-to-stack/master/dist/array-to-stack.js) file.

## Building

```
$ npm run-script build
```

creates the *bundle* file in the `dist` folder.

## Testing

As npm package:

```
$ npm test
```
